# LangChain and Google Generative AI Integration

This repository contains introductory projects that demonstrate the capabilities of LangChain, including integration with Google Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), function tool calling, and fine-tuning. Each project is designed to help you get started with specific aspects of LangChain.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Hello World: LangChain and Google Generative AI
This project demonstrates the installation and initial usage of LangChain along with its integration with Google Generative AI.

#### Features
- **Installation Instructions**: Provides commands for installing LangChain and the LangChain Google Generative AI package.
- **Basic Usage**: Introduces how to set up and begin working with LangChain.

#### Installation
To install the required packages, run the following command in a code cell or your terminal:

```bash
!pip install -Uq langchain langchain-google-genai
```

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project focuses on setting up and using RAG to enhance the accuracy of generative models by leveraging external knowledge bases.

#### Features
- Demonstrates integration with external document retrieval systems.
- Shows how to combine retrieved knowledge with generative models for better responses.

### 3. Function Tool Calling
This project explores the functionality of LangChain for dynamic tool calling within workflows.

#### Features
- Demonstrates how to define and call functions programmatically within LangChain.
- Explores use cases for task automation and dynamic decision-making.

### 4. Fine-Tuning
This project covers the basics of fine-tuning models to adapt them for specific tasks or datasets.

#### Features
- Walks through the fine-tuning process for custom datasets.
- Explains how to integrate fine-tuned models within LangChain pipelines.
